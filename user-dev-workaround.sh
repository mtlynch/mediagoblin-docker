# Workaround because MediaGoblin doesn't fully respect data_basedir in the
# mediagoblin.ini.
#
# When data_basedir is defined in mediagoblin.ini, MediaGoblin writes uploaded
# files to that location, but when it tries to serve files, it still looks for
# them in ./user_dev/media/public.
#
# As a workaround, create a symlink from the incorrect path to the correct
# path.
